Synth & music:    Juippi
Everything else:  Trilkk

FreeBSD-ia32 intro for Revision 2017 pc 4k intro compo. Actually released in
Assembly 2017 combined 4k intro compo, because our portable SDD did not work
in the Revision compo PC for whichever reason.

Should work with Nvidia cards. Or any other cards with OpenGL 4.5 support that
have drivers with GL4.5 support for FreeBSD. Good luck finding those. Ports
exist for other operating systems, but they're not 4k.

The .wav file in the rel/ folder is there because the synth only runs on ia32,
so non-compo builds will just load it.

Extra-special thanks to las/Mercury and Revision compo crew in general for
deleting the release back at the party.
